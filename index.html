          you are currently earning in this meeting. Or because you want to
          calculate how much the current meeting is costing your business. Or you are stuck in an unproductive meeting right now and want to put a price tag on this waste of your time. Have fun!

        <h3>How does the meeting cost calculator work?</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Enter your hourly rate or the avergare rate of all participants of
              the meeting
            </li>
            <li>
              Enter the number of the participants of this meeting
            </li>
            <li>
              Click start and the calculator will count the cost of this meeting
              in realtime
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          If you want the calculator to stop counting just press stop or click
          reset to set the count of this meeting back to zero.

        <h2>3. general notes and mandatory information</h2>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data
          very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in
          accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use this website, various personal data are collected.
          Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified.
          This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it
          for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg
          communication by e-mail) security gaps. A complete protection of the
          data against access by third parties is not possible.
        </p>
        <h3>Note on the responsible body</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>
          [Full name or full company name of the website operator and full
          address].
        </p>
        <p>
          Telephone: [telephone number of the responsible body]<br />
          E-mail: [email address of the responsible party]
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly
          with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of
          personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this
          privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
          purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a
          legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention
          periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data
          will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>
        <p>
          Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
          consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time.
          The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
          remains unaffected by the revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>

          PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED, UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE
          COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING.FOR THE PROCESSING

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right

          basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
          you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
          request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this
          will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to
          protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or
          requests that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize
          an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the
          browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in
          your browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Information, deletion and correction</h3>
        <p>
          Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
          right at any time to free information about your stored personal data,
          its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if
          necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this
          purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal
          data, you can contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
          your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time.
          The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we
            usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review,
            you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
            your personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
            unlawfully, you may request the restriction of data processing
            instead of erasure.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to
            exercise, defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to
            request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
            of deletion.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a
            balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as
            it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
            right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data
          may - apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or
          for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
          protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for
          reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a
          Member State.

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Our Internet pages use so-called "cookies". Cookies are small text
          files and do not cause any damage to your terminal device. They are
          stored either temporarily for the duration of a session (session
          cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your end device.
          Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit.
          Permanent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete
          them yourself or until they are automatically deleted by your web
          browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, cookies from third-party companies may also be stored
          on your terminal device when you enter our site (third-party cookies).
          These enable us or you to use certain services of the third-party
          company (e.g. cookies for processing payment services).
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically
          necessary, as certain website functions would not work without them
          (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other
          cookies are used to evaluate user behavior or display advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication
          process (necessary cookies) or to provide certain functions that you
          have requested (functional cookies, e.g. for the shopping cart
          function) or to optimize the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web
          audience) are stored on the basis of Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, unless
          another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a
          legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free
          and optimized provision of its services. If consent to store cookies
          has been requested, the cookies in question are stored exclusively on
          the basis of this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO); consent can
          be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of
          cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the
          acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general and activate the
          automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. When
          deactivating cookies, the functionality of this website may be
          limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          If cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes,
